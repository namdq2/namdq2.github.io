Hello, I’m Dang Quoc Nam — a technology leader with a strong focus on software architecture, distributed systems, and blockchain innovation.

### Who I Am
I’m currently a Technical Lead at VAR META, where I oversee technical architecture and support the growth of engineering teams.  
I enjoy solving complex problems and building reliable, scalable systems that make an impact.


### What I Do
- Design and maintain system architecture for performance and scalability  
- Mentor and guide engineers to develop strong technical foundations  
- Work on projects that combine blockchain and AI technologies  
- Collaborate closely with product and business teams to align goals and delivery

### Philosophy
I believe good engineering starts with clear thinking and collaboration.  
My approach emphasizes simplicity, maintainability, and continuous improvement.  
Technology should serve people — not the other way around.

### Interests
I’m interested in building systems that can grow sustainably over time, learning from emerging technologies, and contributing to open, decentralized ecosystems.
